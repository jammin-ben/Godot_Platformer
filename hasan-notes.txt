        Trying to implement a game mechanic where the turtle becomes a ball with
        physics reactions whenever the player is holding down. Trying to naviagate
        reworking animations given this mechanic because I want you to be able to
        go into 'ball mode' even while in the air. The idea I have for making this
        work is to have a seperate 'ball mode' turtle and then dynamically switch
        which turtle is active based on signals from animation completions
        (i.e. hide, emerge)

    Trying to setup the Powerup.tscn node to be a 'tool'. The latest thing I'm
    trying to figure out is how to get the CollisionShape2D in the Hurtbox
    child to work. Maybe make the properties setget all the way down?
