    Just a bit of the code needed for the tutorial window still todo:
        - Allow you to select the powerup node that it will listen for to be triggered
        - Allow you to select the animation that will play when its triggerd

    Just implemented a very basic working version of the tutorial UI. It still
        - To figure out how we're going to handle different powerups
            IDEA: have the instance of the UI remove its self from the scene after it is finished. -- I like this one better
            Another possible idea: allow multiple triggers to be added, then have reset code in place for when everything is done

    Working on getting ball mode to work using a state machine. Currently the issue
    is that when coming out of ball-mode, well, he doesn't come out of ball mode.
    Its clear that there is some logical error in the switching-back code. Figure that out

    Still trying to get coming out of ball mode to work properly. For some reason it looks like
    the turt_default isn't actually being set to visible. Its quite strange. May be a good idea
    to try removing the object from the scene and see if that comes with fewer issues
UPDATE:
    - The issue seems to be that something is RE calling the method to set ball mode. Its
    getting called twice somehow. Double check and figure out what is calling it twice
